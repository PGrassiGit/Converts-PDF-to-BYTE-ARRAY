# Convert PDF to BYTE ARRAY

PDF to Base64 Converter (BYTE ARRAY)
This Python script facilitates the conversion of PDF files to Base64 encoding.
It can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with PDF data in a format that is easily shareable and embeddable, like JSON.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pandas
tkinter (included in Python 3)

Usage:
Run the script.
A file dialog will prompt you to select a folder containing PDF files.
The script will then list all the files in the selected folder.
For each file, it will convert the PDF content to Base64 encoding.
The resulting Base64 strings will be printed to the console.


Notes
Ensure that the required libraries (pandas and tkinter) are installed.
The script assumes that the selected folder contains PDF files.
Disclaimer
This script is a basic utility and is a base for modifications.
